# Universe_DB
This database was built in using bash as a part of the project Celestial Body Database from FreeCodeCamp. Here I learned the basic commands for DQL, DDL, and DML.

## Tables
The database has five tables: galaxy, star, planet, moon and spacecraft. Each has information their elements and their main characteristics.
